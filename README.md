## Who I Am
Hello, I'm April Itriago. For close to twenty years, I worked in creative advertising, developing and materializing ideas. Recently, I completed a master's in Data Science and now operate as a Data Scientist. While this might seem like a stark transition to some, for me, it's a logical extension of my career.

In both advertising and data science, the goal is to turn abstract ideas into tangible outcomes. In advertising, this meant crafting impactful ads; in data science, it involves translating data into understandable visualizations and building machine learning models. At its core, I've always been in the business of interpreting and presenting information, whether through advertising campaigns or data analysis.

### 2 **Tanzania Water Pump Fault Prediction**

**Brief Description:** 

In collaboration with DrivenData, this intermediate-level project focused on promoting access to clean water in Tanzania by predicting faulty water pumps. Using a dataset encompassing various water pump features and their operational status, I applied data science techniques to identify malfunctioning pumps. The objective was to enable timely maintenance and ensure consistent water availability to the communities.
