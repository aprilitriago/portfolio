Choosing the mode of transportation is vital for trip planning and structuring sustainable transportation systems. In this study, we used machine learning techniques to analyze and predict transportation decisions based on a dataset derived from the National Travel Survey of the Netherlands. We faced challenges such as class imbalance in the data, which led us to implement meticulous strategies for handling it. Through a detailed process that included data analysis, feature engineering, feature selection, and hyperparameter optimization, we applied several machine learning algorithms. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm stood out, achieving an F1 (macro) score of 70.32% on the training set and 93.58% on the test set. Additionally, we identified key variables such as 'distance_tr' and 'age_tr' that significantly influence the choice of transportation mode. These results, although illustrative, emphasize the importance of continuing to refine the model to address the identified overfitting. Despite the challenges, XGBoost's ability to manage complex and unbalanced data remains evident. However, it is essential to continue with adjustments and reviews to ensure more consistent and robust predictions.
